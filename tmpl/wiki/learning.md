# How to learn about Mirage

The Mirage [community](/community) is very welcoming of newcomers; your
optimal learning route is try out the software on your own development
machine, then familiarise yourself with the various backends and the
main modules and techniques used in building and running real unikernels.

If you know some OCaml but don't know about Mirage, your first steps should
be to try either our [Hello Mirage World](/hello-world) tutorial, or go
directly to building some of the example apps in [Mirage Skeleton](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton).

Mirage abstracts away various OS-level functionality, which must be provided
by backends. These include access to networking and storage.

## How to get help

A brief survey of the Mirage development community revealed that the
preferred method of getting help is the email mailing list: the core
developers all read it. Mailing lists aren't for everyone, so here are
the alternatives, roughly in descending order of preference:

* [the mailing list](http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel)
* filing Issue tickets on relevant [Github repositories](https://github.com/mirage)
* the OCaml Labs Slack channel
* [The OCaml message board](https://discuss.ocaml.org/)
* `#mirage` on the freenode IRC network
